With faster routing, improved server actions, better caching strategies, and a cleaner architecture, it reinforces its position as the most powerful React framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new Turbopack improvements drastically reduce cold starts and hot reload times. Meanwhile, App Router refinements and enhanced SEO tooling make it easier than ever to build production-grade applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your current project uses Next.js 12 or 13, upgrading will deliver noticeable boosts in speed and DX. The future of React development is server-first&mdash;and Next.js is leading the charge.</p>",

Its ability to detect errors during development instead of at runtime saves companies thousands of hours each year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond type safety, TypeScript improves code readability, enables powerful tooling, and increases long-term maintainability&mdash;especially in large teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frameworks like <strong>Next.js</strong>, <strong>NestJS</strong>, <strong>React Native</strong>, and <strong>Expo</strong> now strongly encourage or default to TypeScript. If you&#39;re trying to future-proof your career, learning TypeScript isn&rsquo;t optional anymore&mdash;it&#39;s a competitive advantage.</p>",
